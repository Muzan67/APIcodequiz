We were tasked to create an interactive time coding assessment with a combination of multiple-choice questions with answers
The app will run in our browser and feature HTML, CSS , and JavaScript code.

I tried my best to complete my work but I had many trouble getting the questions to launch. 

I was able to style and implement some functions of what was expected for this assignment.
